C# is a general-purpose, object-oriented programming language (OOP) Developed by Microsoft within its .NET initiative.  
It is fundamentally rooted in the C and C++ family of languages and borrows aspects from Java, making C# very familiar for Developers of those languages


Hello World in c# is the following!

using System;
class Program
{
  static void Main(string[] args)
  { 
    Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
  } 
}


The .NET Framework is a language-agnostic software development and runtime platform developed by Microsoft. 
It provides a controlled environment for developing and running applications.
Programs written for the .NET Framework execute in a software environment known as the Common Language Runtime (CLR), an application virtual machine that provides services such as security, memory management, and exception handling. 

There are many different components to the .NET Framework; some are listed below:

The Common Language Runtime (CLR) is the execution engine for .NET Framework applications. It provides various services, such as memory management and thread management.
  The .NET Framework Class Library (FCL) is a standard library that encapsulates many common functions, such as file reading and writing, graphic rendering, database interaction, and XML document manipulation.
    Common Language Specification (CLS) is a set of rules and standards that enforce language interoperability.
      Common Type System (CTS) is a standard that defines all possible data types and programming constructs supported by CLR and how they interact.
